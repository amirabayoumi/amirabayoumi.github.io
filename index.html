          <p>
            Hello! I've recently dived into the exciting world of coding;
            programming has always been a lifelong dream of mine. Since my
            teenage years, I've had a deep curiosity about computers and new
            technologies.
            <br />
            Over the last three years, I've been deeply involved in the world of
            fiber optics, new generation 5G networks, and telecommunications.
            This hands-on experience has ignited my interest in programming and
            data analysis, pushing me to learn further in this exciting field.
            <br />

            <br />
            Originally from Egypt, my educational journey took me through a
            scientific high school in Dubai, followed by earning a bachelor's
            degree in geophysics back in Egypt. Having lived in four different
            countries, I've become deeply appreciative of diverse cultures,
            cuisines, and art forms. I'm particularly drawn to the cultural
            richness of dance, enjoying its variations across different
            cultures. When I'm not coding, you'll often find me dancing,
            cooking, indulging in diverse cuisines, or exploring new forms of
            art.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, I've found my new home in Belgium, particularly in the
            diverse and welcoming city of Antwerp. The warmth and diversity of
            this city resonate deeply with my values and aspirations.

          <p class="title">An overview of my coding journey</p>
          <p>
            Witnessing the transformative power of technology as it reshapes our
            world into a digital hub has motivated me to pursue a career as a
            full-stack developer. I'm not just chasing personal growth; I want
            to create user-friendly platforms that help people adapt to the
            ever-changing digital age.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I continue on my learning journey, I've gained proficiency in
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

          <p>
            Additionally, I'm skilled in utilizing Git and GitHub for version
            control and collaboration.

          <p>
            Moreover, I have experience with Figma, which I use for designing
            and prototyping user interfaces.

          <p>
            I've also become acquainted with Agile methodology, enabling me to
            smoothly navigate sprints and collaborate effectively within the
            company's collaboration system.

          <p>
            I'm excited to be part of the tech community and meet new people.
